# Portfolio Projects

---
This repository is a portfolio of data science and analytics projects I've completed for the purpose of showcasing my work, as well as for practice via topics that interest me.


### [Open Powerlifting Exploratory Data Analysis](https://github.com/jfox1620/Portfolio/tree/main/Powerlifting%20Exploratory%20Analysis)

An analysis of up-to-date data on powerlifting competition meets. Data is pulled, processed, feature engineered, and visualized with Python in a Juptyer notebook. A Power BI report visualizes the cleaned data. For the Power BI report, both a PDF (for a quick view) and PBIX file (for download with the associated data) are included.
